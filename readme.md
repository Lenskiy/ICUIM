The module proposes an extension to real-time protocol (RTP) that uses computational capacities of mobile devices to detect objects/regions of interest and apply lesser compression to these regions, while the remaining background is compressed with a higher compression ratio. The module supports multiple compression ratios depending on the importance of the detected regions.
